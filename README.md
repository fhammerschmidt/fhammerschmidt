Hello there!

My name is Florian, and I am writing ReasonML and React (Native) for a living @ [cca_io](https://www.cca.io/)!

You can also read some blogposts from me, either on [dev.to](https://dev.to/fhammerschmidt) or directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/fhammerschmidt/blogposts), if you prefer that.
